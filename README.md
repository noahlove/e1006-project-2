A Dialog System for Ordering Pizza

A dialog system (or conversational agent) is a computer program intended to communicate with humans in natural language,
following a specific dialog structure to accomplish a specific tasks. Common examples are automatic phone systems for 
flight reservations or personal assistants such as Siri and Alexa. In this problem we will use functions to write a 
very basic dialog system (with limited vocabulary). The system should allow the user to order from an Italian restaurant 
by asking specific questions. Here is an example Dialog: 

Python prints: "Hello, would you like pizza or salad?"

User types: "pizza"

Python: "Small, medium, or large?"

User: "large"

Python: "Add a topping: pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach, or say 'done'"

User: "mushrooms"

Python: "Add a topping: pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach, or say 'done'"

User: "spinach"

Python: "Add a topping: pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach, or say 'done'"
User: "done"
Python: "You ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and spinach. Place another order or say 'done'.

                   Hello, would you like pizza or salad?"

User: "salad"

Python: "Would you like a garden salad or greek salad"

User: "greek"

Python: "please choose a dressing: vinaigrette, ranch, blue cheese, lemon"

User: "blue cheese"

Python: "You ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and spinach and a greek salad with blue cheese dressing. Place another
order or say  'done'.

               Hello, would you like pizza or salad?"

User: "done"

Python: "Your order has been placed. Goodbye."

Implement functions to prompt the user, as illustrated in the diagram below. For example, the salad() function should
ask the user for a type of salad. Then the salad() functions calls the dressing() method to asks for a dressing.

All functions return a string, so that you can assemble the order as a string in the calling function. The dressing() 
function would return the type of dressing, for example "blue cheese". The salad() function would combine the dressing 
and the salad type into "greek salad with lemon dressing". Finally, the select_meal() function would assemble the 
complete order in a string.

Note that the functions do not have any parameters. Instead, they should all read user input and then return that input
formatted as a string or a list.

The following diagram illustrates the order in which the functions should be called and how the result string should be 
assembled from the return values step-by-step.

Some complications: 
- The toppings() function should ask for toppings repeatedly until the user types "done". The return value of the 
  toppings method should be a single string including the toppings, for example "pepperoni and mushrooms and spinach".
- The select_meal function should ask the user repeatedly to add an item until the user types "done". It should assemble 
  a string representing the complete order.  

Hints:
- None of the functions take any parameters. The important part in this problem is that you are calling functions from
  within other functions ("nested" function calls). 
- Use string formatting with {} place holders to assemble the strings. Make sure to write all functions specified in the 
  diagram, and only those functions with the specified behavior. 

Write all your functions in a file project2.py. On the top level of project2.py (no indentation), simply call

    select_meal()

to start the dialog system.
